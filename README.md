📌Facebook sign up page 


📌 Project Description

I created a Facebook Sign Up Page clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on form handling, validation, and user interaction.

✅ Form Fields: Name, Email, Password, Age, and Gender selection.

✅ Validation:

Name must not be empty.

Email must follow proper email format.

Password must meet minimum length and complexity.

Age must be a valid number within the required range.

❌ Invalid Input: Shows an alert message if validation fails.

✔️ Valid Input: If all fields are correct, the entered values are displayed in the browser console.

🎨 UI: Styled with CSS to look clean, responsive, and inspired by Facebook’s sign-up form.
